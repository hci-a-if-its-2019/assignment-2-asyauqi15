The writers choose solution one because in writes's opinion, 
- Have better design

```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
In assignment-1 , I have interview with a user to test a website.
He feel confused to do my instruction because of some design.
He has trouble to see the other post, because the button not too visible.
He said that the design of this website too boring.
Search column not easy to find because the position no eye catching.
